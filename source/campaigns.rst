Campaigns
=========

Campaign Types

    basket. For example, a customer may be given a 5% discount off
    their total order if their basket contains at least 10 products.

Catalog Campaign
    A campaign that is offered shop-wide based on the customer,
    product, product type, or other such conditions.

Rules and Effects
-----------------

Whether or not a campaign be applied to a particular order and how it
will be applied depends on its *Rules* and *Effects*.

Rules
    The conditions or criteria that an order must meet before a
    campaign will be applied. These may include having a basket with
    a certain total value (for a basket campaign) or requiring the
    customer to belong to a specific customer group (for a catalog
    campaign). Different rules will be available depending on whether
    they are being applied to a basket campaign or a catalog campaign.

Effects
    If a customer's order meets the requirements of all of the
    campaign's rules, any enabled effects will be applied to their
    order. These are usually discounts applied to the order, such as
    discounts on the total basket value, discounted or free quantities
    of a particular product, or other various types of discounts.

Coupons
    Used to limit usage of a basket campaign to only holders of a valid
    coupon code.
