Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Placeholders define the regions that a plugin may be included on a
page. The theme source code defines where in the shop's pages
placeholders will appear.

To edit placeholders, enter edit more and click the placeholder you
wish to edit.

See `Editing a Page`_ for more information.

.. note::

   Changes to regular placeholders only affect a single page or view.

   However, if a placeholder is a *global* placeholder, any changes
   will be reflected site-wide. Typically, these are used in areas
   such as headers or footers.

   Refer to your theme documentation regarding which placeholders are
   global placeholders.

Plugins
~~~~~~~

Shuup Xtheme plugins provide an easy way for merchants to customize
their shop frontend.

Shuup comes with a selection of default plugins, or plugins may be
provided by themes or addons.

1. Enter edit mode and click the placeholder to which you want to add
   plugins.
