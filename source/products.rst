Cross-Selling
-------------

Adding Cross-Sells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related products can be sold together on Shoop's storefront by
using Shoop's cross-selling feature. These relationships can be
managed from the Shoop Product admin.

To add a relationship for a particular product, navigate to the product's
page and select `Manage Cross-Selling` from the `Actions` menu.

.. image:: products/action-menu.png

Products can be selected by clicking the Browse button and clicking on
the desired product from the product list.

.. image:: products/cross-sells-add-relationship.png

Once the product has been selected, the relationship's weight can be set.

The relationship weight is used when calculating which products will
be displayed together on the shop front. The higher the relationship
weight the more likely the products are to be displayed together.

Finally, you can select one of the following relationship types:

Recommended
   Products are recommended to be bought together.
Related
   Products are related.
Computed
   Primarily reserved for use by add-ons.
Bought With
   Primarily reserved for internal use. These relationships are
   automatically calculated by automated Shoop tasks, however if
   these tasks have not been configured by the server administrator,
   they can be defined manually here.

.. note::
   Only five relationships can be added at once. However, more can
   be added once these relationships have been savd. This can be
   repeated as necessary.

Displaying Cross-Sells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once defined in the Product admin, cross-sell relationships can be
displayed on the store front using the Xtheme Cross-Sells plugin.

.. image:: products/cross-sells-displayed.png

Follow the following steps to display a relationship type on the
store front:

1.  Make sure you are logged in as an administrator and navigate to
    the store front.
2.  Navigate to any product page.
3.  Click on the `Edit Page` button in the lower right-hand corner
    of the page.
4.  Select one of the Xtheme placeholder boxes.
5.  Add a new row or new column for your plugin.
6.  Select `Product Cross Sells` from the plugin dropdown menu.
7.  Add a title if desired, select the relationship type, and set
    the count as the number of products to be displayed at once.
    You can also select whether or not to hide out-of-stock or
    unorderable items.
8.  Save the plugin.
9.  Publish your changes.
10. Click the `Exit Edit` button in the lower right-hand corner of
    the page

    page.

.. The page will now enter an editable draft mode and depending on the
   theme template settings, dashed Xtheme placeholder boxes should become
   visible on the page. These may be empty boxes by default.

.. note::
   Cross-sell relationships are only one-way and must be manually added
   to any related product you would like to relate back to the original
   product.

.. note::
   If there are no relationships of the selected type for a particular
   product, the plugin will not be displayed.

Package Products
----------------

Package products are used to package a number of related products to be
sold as a single product package.

These products are stored a single package *parent*, which can be
linked to multiple package *children*.

Stock for child products is automatically updated when the package is
purchased. Pricing, discounts, etc, of the parent product can be
managed like any other product.

To convert a product to a package parent:

1. Navigate to the parent product's edit page and select `Convert to
   Package Parent` from the `Actions` dropdown menu.

   .. image:: products/convert-to-package-parent-dropdown.png

2. Click the `Browse` button to add child products to the package.
   Enter the quantity of each product to include in the package.

   .. image:: products/package-products-form.png

3. Click `Save` to save the package's child product informatino.


Variation Products
------------------

Some products may be available to customers in a number of different
variations, and customers should be able to choose from these
different available options when adding products to their cart.

Shoop provides two different types of product variations, `simple
variations` and `variable variations`.

Simple Variations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple variations are general variations that are displayed on the
product page as a simple drop-down menu where the user can select
from any of the available variation product choices.

Variable Variations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variable variations allow you to define child products based on a
specific variable. For example, a product might have variables such as
`size` or `colors`, with different options for each, and the customer
should be able to select from a combination of these options.

To add variable variations:

1. Navigate to the parent product's edit page and select `Convert to
   Variation Parent` from the `Actions` menu.
2. Select `Variables` from the left-hand menu
3. Click `Add new variable` to add a new variable form
4. Enter the variable name
5. Click `Add new value`
6. Enter names for possible values
7. Continue for other variables/values as needed
8. When finished, click `Save` in the toolbar

.. image:: products/variable-product-selector.png

Once these variables have been added, "child" products can be linked
for each combination of variables. For example, if there are 3 `size`
values and 2 `color` values, there will be 6 child products, one for
each `size`, `color` combination.

.. tip::
   Names for child products should follow a consistent naming scheme
   indicating the variable value for each product.

.. tip::
   Variable variations can be converted to simple variations
   by clicking `Convert to simple variation` on the Variation view
   toolbar. However, all variable and value information will be lost.

Managing Variations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once a product has been converted to a simple or variable variation
parent, it can be managed by selecting `Manage Variations` from the
`Actions` menu for either the variation parent's admin page or the
admin page for any of the child variation products.
