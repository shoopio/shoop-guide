When users are deactivated, they remain in your system however they
will no longer be able to log in to their account and by default are
not displayed when first opening the Users admin page.

.. note::
   If a user has an associated contact, deactiving the user's user
   account will not deactive their contact, although it will prevent
   them from logging in, essentially accomplishing the same thing.

   See `Deactivating a Contact`_ for more information.

To deactivate a user:

1. Navigate to the Users admin page by clicking `Users` under the
   `Contacts` category from the Shuup Admin menu.

   .. image:: customers-and-users/users-menu.png

Permission Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permission groups can be used to restrict access to different sections
of the Shuup admin for staff-level users.

Creating a Permission Group
---------------------------

1. Navigate to the Permission Groups admin page by clicking `Permission
   Groups` under the `Contacts` category from the Shuup Admin menu.

   the group should have access to, and select any users that should be
   members of this group.

   .. image:: customers-and-users/permission-groups-form.png

   .. note::

      Permissions are managed on a module-level basis. For example, if
      a user has access to the Orders module, they will have access to
      create orders, shipments, payments, refunds.

      Additionally, if two admin modules require the same permission
      rights, adding one module will automatically add the second once
      the group settings have been saved.

4. Click `Save` to save the permission group settings.

Contacts
~~~~~~~~

Shuup contacts store contact information such as address data, email, or
phone numbers, and a contact may or may not be associated with a
user account.

Contacts may be one of the two following types:

Person contact
   Contact associated with a person.
Company contact
   Contact associated with a company.

One or more person contacts may be *members* of a company contact.

However, if a user has a contact associated with their account, it must
always be a *person*-type contact, which may then be a member of one or
more *company* contacts.

If a user's person contact is linked to a company, the company's contact
information will be used when placing orders.

      last name.

      required and will be used as the company name. In this case, the
      first and last names will not be used.
