Payment and Shipping
====================

In Shuup, payment and shippings choices are associated with particular
service providers. These may be provided by Shuup's build-in carriers
or payment process, or may be provided by payment or shipping-related
addons.

Behavior Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a customer checks out, they are presented the choice of any
available payment methods for their order.

Whether a particular payment method is applicable to an order depends
on its behavior, which is comprised of any number of `behavior
components`.

`Behavior components` are essentially just individual components that,
when taken together, define.

1. Whether a payment method is available for an order
2. The amount to charge for that payment method, if available

Shuup also ships with the following basic components (although
behavior components can also be added by :ref:`Addons`):

Fixed cost
  Add a fixed cost.
Waiving cost
  Add a cost that is only applied up to a price limit.
Weight limits
  Limit availability of the service based on total weight of products.
Weight-based pricing range
  Add a cost to the order if it is within a specific weight range

.. note::
   If there are multiple valid weight-based pricing ranges for an
   order, the cheapest-option will be selected.

Adding a Behavior Component to a Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Navigate to the Shipping or Payment Methods admin by clicking
   `Shipping Methods` or `Payment Methods` under the `Payment and
   Shipping` category from the Shuup Admin menu.
